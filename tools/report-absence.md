			<h3>Reporting an Absence</h3>
			<p>
				It happens to the best of us.<br />
				If your Child is feeling poorly, and you don't think you can send them in or something else is the matter, instead of giving us a phone-call you can submit the form to your right, which will tell our computer to skip them from registration.  Just please remember to send in a sick-note when they're back.<br />
				<b>Disclaimer:</b> Please do not use this form for impromptu holidays.  Holidays during term-time must be pre-approved, and booked in advance.
