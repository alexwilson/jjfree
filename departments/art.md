When you hear the word "Art", your mind may be immediately drawn to the likes of Michelangelo's ceiling in the Sistine chapel, or the Antonio Gaudi's “Sagrada Família”, and while these works of art are truly wondrous they are not a reflection of the term, as it carries greater cultural significance.  In our everyday lives, we are surrounded by print media, advertising, cars, buildings, books, and many more things.  All of which will have had their designs carefully inspired, planned and implemented.  Our modern age has truly empowered art, and artists.

 At JJFree we aim to foster the creative development of your Children, and to teach them how to paint and draw, but foremost, we will strive to teach them how to think creatively.  Our aim is to help develop the next generation of artists, to surpass even our own achievements.
