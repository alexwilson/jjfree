_The year was 1958..._ <br />
Aged 15, Bobby Fischer stared intently at the chess board, his mind racing in silent agony, trying to anticipate every move his opponent could possibly muster ... _and then some_.  The English defense was a good one, yes, but he'd seen it beaten plenty a time before - Just this time the stakes were much higher - Everything was riding on this.   Indeed he already had everything in position, but his opponent was __more__ than formidable.

He had his pieces in position, the tension was palpable... 

The year was 1958.  Young Bobby Fischer beat a World Champion, and went on to become both the youngest ever holder of the title, and a chess grand master.

Nothing can beat the sheer mental exertion and excitement of an involving game of Chess, and here at JJFree we aim to help Children discover their talent and passions for Chess.  In our club, we will support your Child through their exploration of the field of Chess, and who knows - They might give Fischer a run for his money.
