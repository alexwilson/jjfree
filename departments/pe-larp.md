LARPing, or Live-Action Role-Playing, is at the end of the day, a whole lot of fun.

Exactly what it entails can vary from person to person, group to group, but essentially it is a highly creative spin on drama or improv, centered around a certain theme.

Our club centers around running short games of [Treasure Trap](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Trap), of Blue Peter fame, which helps Children develop by putting them in morally safe situations in which they might not otherwise gain experience.  Overall this lets Children blow off steam, and also provides an engaging end to each week - Something to look forward to.

Before signing up, feel free to approach a teacher with any concerns or questions you might have.
