Here at JJFree's PE department, children are inspired and motivated to do well by a highly qualified team of staff.  With alumni in several national sporting teams, give your child the right start to their sporting careers here at JJFree.

We also support a broad spectrum of extracurricular activities, and actively support children who wish to do something new or different.  Our belief is that this helps your Children pursue their ambition in later life.
