Here we're always looking to improve the education that we deliver to our students, and so to this end we are pleased to announce that we will be  investing all of the money pooled through donations and our School Foundation, to build a brand-new Computer and Science Laboratory building. 

Naturally to build such a facility will take some time, but we envisige it being completed during early Spring term next year.

We will be making use of the new building immediately, to give greater depth to our existing curriculum, with lessons inspired from famous educational institutions.  These lessons will start immediately, and we hope to enrich our pupils this way!

We are looking forward to announcing the opening of this new building, and I personally am very excited about the prospects it brings!
