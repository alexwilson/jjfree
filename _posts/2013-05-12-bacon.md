Our school has once again prevailed in this years round of so-called “11+ examinations”, and this year the entirity of our year-6 cohort have made it into their first-choice private, grammar and public schools.  While not unexpected, it is still pleasant to hear that so many of our alumni will continue to get the best education to both fuel and progress them throughout their lives.
