We are proud to announce that work on our new building has been completed, after many months of intensive construction.

The greatest of care has been taken in ensuring that the on-site building does not disrupt the school day, and the entire process has gone fairly smoothly, and so we are now prooud to boast our own state-of-the-art Computer and Science laboratory building.

Our state-of-the art Computer Science labs have been built in consultation with Oxford University's School of Computer Science, and consequently we will be adding GeoLAB inspired lessons taken directly from Oxford to our curriculum, to give our pupils the greatest possible start to their CompSci education.  Such a footing will prove essential in our increasingly information oriented society.

Meanwhile the science laboratories are non-specialised, carrying equipment for all three facets of science - Biology, Chemistry and Physics - which will help aide students better understand our existing syllabus, with practical demonstrations and other hands-on experience.  For example, we will now be able to safely show off a proper Thermite reaction!
