title: About our school
---
JJFree is a traditional school, with modern techniques.  We were founded in the early 1900s as an all-boys private junior school to raise our next generation of leaders, and have since expanded by opening our doors to girls, and by waiving our fees in lieu of donations, grants and government supplements.

We are currently structured as an academy, although our previous and current success, along with our exemplary board of directors, has ensured that we will remain around for at least another century yet.

Recently we have been investing in new buildings, to better accommodate the needs of our teachers and pupils, with one recently completed in early 2014.  We invest both our time and our money into ensuring that all who pass through our school, whether they be pupils, parents, or even teachers, are both intellectually and culturally enriched by the end of it.
